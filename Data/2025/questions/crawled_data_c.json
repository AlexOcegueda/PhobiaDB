            "What is cacophobia?": "Cacophobia is an intense fear of ugliness. The condition is a specific phobia (fear), which is a type ofanxiety disorder. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services.Policy People with cacophobia might be afraid of looking ugly themselves, or they might worry about seeing something they consider to be ugly. A person with cacophobia might fear all forms of ugliness or a specific kind, such as perceived ugliness in people, animals, places or objects. People with cacophobia can get very stressed or anxious when they think about or see something they consider to be ugly. The condition can also affect personal and professional relationships. People with this condition may understand that their fear is extreme, but may not be able to control it.",
            "What are people with cachophobia afraid of?": "Most phobias are objective, meaning they have to do with things that are indisputable. For example, being afraid of snakes is objective because the definition of snake can’t be disputed. A snake is clearly a snake. But cacophobia is subjective. An individual with cacophobia determines what’s ugly and what’s not. One person with cacophobia may be terrified of a certain “ugly” object, but another person with cacophobia might not react at all to the same thing.",

This talk therapy can help people unlearn negative thoughts that happen when they think about or encounter ugliness. One type of CBT is dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).

Exposure therapy:Exposure therapy, sometimes called desensitization, helps people confront their fears. The therapy exposes a person to things they fear — gradually, in a controlled environment. Exposure therapy starts with something less scary, like a picture of something mildly ugly. Through increased exposure, people can learn to manage cacophobia. Hypnotherapy:Hypnotherapycan put a person in a trance-like but focused state. A person under hypnosis is more open to suggestions and change. A hypnotist may be able to convince a hypnotized person that something they thought was ugly isn’t. Or perhaps the hypnotist can convince the person that ugliness isn’t to be feared. Medications:Antianxiety medications can lessen anxiety and its symptoms. The drugs aren’t a cure for cacophobia. But they can help people face certain situations when necessary. Advertisement",

Often, anxiety can be helpful and even protect you — it tells you that something’s wrong or dangerous. This is your “fight or flight” response. But sometimes, this response occurs when it shouldn’t, or occurs in an unnecessarily intense way, leading to the development of a phobia. Researchers don’t know exactly why this happens in certain people. But several factors may contribute to cardiophobia.
