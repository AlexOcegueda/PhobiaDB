        "name": "Mageirocophobia (Fear of Cooking)",
        "description": "Mageirocophobia occurs when you\u2019re fearful of cooking or the idea of cooking. You may experience intense anxiety or go out of your way to avoid cooking. For many people, this phobia stems from not wanting to make mistakes.",
        "data": {
            "What is mageirocophobia?": "Mageirocophobia is an extreme fear of cooking. It\u2019s a specific phobia, meaning that it causes fear of a particular situation. Mageirocophobia may stem from other mental health issues, including: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), known for its repetitive thoughts and urges.\nPerfectionism, an expectation of flawlessness that, when not met, causes severe self-criticism. This phobia may also stem from a fear of making mistakes. These mistakes can lead to: Fires: Stoves, ovens, microwaves and other kitchen appliances can cause fires. If there\u2019s a grease fire, it can spread quickly and be difficult to put out.\nFood poisoning: Certain foods can make you sick if not fully cooked.\nUnappetizing food: Simple mistakes like cooking food too long can make it unpleasant to eat.\nInjuries: There\u2019s a small risk of injury when using sharp objects.\nStress: Cooking takes time and concentration, which can be difficult when you\u2019re busy.",
            "What does mageirocophobia mean?": "Many people feel anxious about preparing food, trying a new recipe or cooking for other people. With mageirocophobia, cooking or watching someone else cook can bring severe anxiety. Some people experience overwhelming symptoms that lead to panic attacks. There\u2019s no reason to feel self-conscious about possibly having a phobia. And there are therapies that can lessen its impact on your life. Talking to your healthcare provider can be one of the first steps toward getting better.",
            "What are mageirocophobia causes?": "Genetics and environmental factors can increase the risk of specific phobias like mageirocophobia: Genetics: A family history of mood disorders can raise your risk of anxiety and phobias.\nEnvironment: Experiencing emotional trauma related to cooking raises the risk of mageirocophobia. You may have experienced a kitchen fire or harsh feedback from previous cooking attempts.",
            "What are mageirocophobia symptoms?": "Mageirocophobia symptoms include behaviors and physical responses. Behaviors that can affect your daily life include: Refusing to set foot in a kitchen for fear of seeing someone cooking.\nWorking in professions where you don\u2019t have to see or think about people cooking.\nAvoiding restaurants so you won\u2019t risk seeing other people cook.

            "How is mageirocophobia diagnosed?": "Tests aren\u2019t needed. Instead, your healthcare provider asks you about symptoms and behaviors. They may ask: If you have a personal or family history of social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia.\nHow often you think about cooking.\nHow thinking about cooking makes you feel.\nWhat aspects of cooking give you anxiety.\nWhether the fear of cooking has led to changes in your daily routine.\nIf you\u2019re avoiding activities or places you used to enjoy because of this phobia.",
            "What is mageirocophobia treatment like?": "A common mageirocophobia treatment is exposure therapy. A therapist very gradually exposes you to cooking and teaches you healthier coping methods. Therapy starts with low-risk exposures, such as pictures of people cooking. As treatment progresses, you take steps toward cooking on your own. With successful treatment, you become more comfortable being around cooking. Additional treatments may include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Undergoing CBT helps you explore why cooking causes anxiety. You also learn how to not give in to negative thoughts.\nMedications: Drugs don\u2019t cure mageirocophobia. But antidepressants can help with mood disorders, and anti-anxiety medications can help you get through a stressful situation.\nStress reduction: Yoga, meditation and other relaxation techniques can help clear your mind. This may make you feel more confident about overcoming mageirocophobia.",
            "Is there anything I can do to prevent mageirocophobia?": "If you face a higher risk of anxiety disorders, you can take steps to manage them. Doing so may lower the risk of situations that cause anxiety to escalate into phobias.

            "What is the outlook for people with mageirocophobia?": "Exposure therapy and other treatments help you overcome the fear of cooking. Doing so can make it easier to go about your daily life. Cooking may still sometimes cause anxiety, but knowing how to calm your mind can prevent these feelings from escalating.",
            "What else is important to know about overcoming mageirocophobia?": "Learning more about cooking can make it easier to overcome mageirocophobia. You can do this by: Finding out more about food safety rules. This may include learning how to use a digital food thermometer to make sure food is at a safe temperature.\nAsking a friend to show you how to cook something you like to eat. This approach allows you to ask questions.\nTaking a cooking class. When you go to a class, a lot of the prep work is already taken care of, so you can focus on cooking.\nUsing a grocery delivery service. This service helps you avoid a potentially triggering situation and enables you to have ready-made food at home. A note from Cleveland Clinic Mageirocophobia is an extreme fear of cooking. Many people with this condition worry about the results of their cooking. They fear cooking mistakes that could be embarrassing or harm someone else. You might go out of your way to avoid cooking or the thought of it. This approach can worsen the fear\u2019s grip on your life. But you don\u2019t have to live this way.

        "name": "Megalophobia",
        "description": "People with megalophobia have an intense fear of large objects such as skyscrapers, airplanes and big statues. Like other specific phobias, megalophobia is highly treatable with a psychological therapy called exposure therapy.",
        "data": {
            "What is megalophobia?": "Megalophobia is a type of anxiety disorder in which a person experiences intense fear of large objects. A person with megalophobia experiences intense fear and anxiety when they think of or are around large objects such as large buildings, statues, animals and vehicles. They often avoid situations or places that have large objects.",
            "What kind of large objects are people with megalophobia afraid of?": "The following objects can trigger people with megalophobia to experience intense fear and anxiety: Tall buildings, such as skyscrapers.\nLarge statues and monuments.\nLarge or vast natural features like mountains, volcanoes, lakes and oceans.\nBig boats, ships and barges.\nLarge vehicles, such as trains and buses.\nLarge or vast spaces, such as the inside of a stadium.\nBig animals, such as elephants and whales. Since there are many kinds of phobias, they can be a little challenging to diagnose. People who have megalophobia generally fear more than one kind of large object. There are other phobias that are characterized by a fear of something that happens to be large, but its size isn\u2019t the main aspect of the fear. As an example, if you have an intense fear of the ocean (which is a large \u201cobject\u201d) specifically, you may have thalassophobia, the fear of the ocean, and not megalophobia. If you\u2019re experiencing intense fear, it\u2019s important to see your healthcare provider so you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.",
            "Who does megalophobia affect?": "Like other phobias, megalophobia can affect anyone at any age. Specific phobias, like megalophobia, are more likely to develop in children and become apparent in adolescents and young adults. Females are more likely to develop specific phobias.",
            "Is megalophobia common?": "Researchers don\u2019t yet know the exact number of people who have megalophobia, which is likely because many people with specific phobias like megalophobia don\u2019t seek treatment for their phobia. Specific phobias, in general, are a common mental health condition. Approximately 7 to 10% of the population has a phobia.",
            "What are the signs and symptoms of megalophobia?": "People with phobias often go to extreme lengths to avoid situations that involve what they are afraid of. If a person with megalophobia isn\u2019t able to avoid large objects and is near large objects, they may experience the following symptoms: Feel intense fear and anxiety.\nExperience a rapid heartbeat.\nHave shortness of breath.\nFeel dizzy and lightheaded.\nFeel nauseous.\nFeel a strong desire to escape the situation.",
            "What causes megalophobia?": "Researchers aren\u2019t sure what exactly causes megalophobia. They believe that having a negative or traumatic experience that involved a large object may contribute to a person developing megalophobia.",
            "How is megalophobia diagnosed?": "Megalophobia is diagnosed through a thorough series of questions about the person\u2019s history, experiences and symptoms. Usually, you have to have had experienced persistent fear and anxiety of large objects for at least six months in order to be diagnosed with megalophobia. Your healthcare provider will likely use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a publication by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose megalophobia. Your provider will also rule out any other physical or mental health conditions that could be causing your symptoms. In general, phobias have at least four criteria for diagnosis, including: Intense and unreasonable fear: The fear of the object or situation is persistent and out of proportion to an appropriate level of fear.\nAnticipatory anxiety: An individual who has a phobia tends to dwell on or dread future situations or experiences that will involve the object or situation they are afraid of.\nAvoidance: Many people who have a phobia will actively avoid the feared object or situation. Some go to extreme lengths to avoid the thing they are afraid of.\nThe phobia interferes with day-to-day activities: The fear the individual experiences has to limit their everyday life in some way in order for it to be diagnosed as a phobia.",
            "Is there a test for megalophobia?": "There\u2019s no definitive test to diagnose megalophobia. Instead, your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your history, symptoms and experiences related to your fear of large objects to assess whether or not you have megalophobia.",
            "How is megalophobia treated?": "Megalophobia can usually be treated with psychological treatment (psychotherapy) such as exposure therapy and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. It\u2019s not very common, but sometimes people need medications that temporarily relieve symptoms of fear and anxiety in order to cope with fear while they are participating in therapy. Exposure therapy Exposure therapy is a common form of psychological treatment used to treat specific phobias. People with phobias usually avoid situations that involve the thing they are afraid of. Because of this, they aren\u2019t able to learn that they can manage their fear when presented with their specific phobia or that their feared outcomes often do not happen. Therapists and psychologists use exposure therapy for people who have a phobia to slowly encourage them to enter situations that cause them anxiety and to try to stay in that situation so that they can learn to cope. If you have megalophobia and participate in exposure therapy, your therapist or psychologist may begin with talking about large objects. They may then gradually move on to showing you pictures of large objects. Next, they may have you look at and be near a large object in person. The process of exposure therapy is slow and gradual. Your therapist or psychologist will tailor the pace of the therapy to your needs. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) CBT is a form of psychological treatment. Through talking and asking questions, your therapist or psychologist helps you gain a different perspective. As a result, you learn to respond better to and cope with the stress and anxiety you feel when you are exposed to things that cause you fear.",
            "What medications are used to treat megalophobia?": "Medications aren\u2019t usually used to treat specific phobias like megalophobia. But in some cases, people with megalophobia might take medications to temporarily help them relieve symptoms of fear and anxiety when they are going through psychological therapy to treat their phobia. Medications sometimes used to help treat megalophobia include: Beta blockers: Some beta blockers are used to treat or prevent physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a fast heart rate.\nSedatives (benzodiazepines): Benzodiazepines, which are a type of sedative, help you relax and reduce the amount of anxiety you feel.",
            "Is there a cure for megalophobia?": "There is currently no cure for megalophobia, but exposure therapy, a form of psychological therapy, is successful in treating it. Exposure therapy is considered the first-line treatment for specific phobias in general.",
            "What are the risk factors for developing megalophobia?": "Healthcare professionals are still trying to figure out the exact cause of megalophobia. So far, they\u2019ve found that the risk factors for developing megalophobia can include: Experiencing or witnessing a negative event that involved a large object, especially as a child.\nHaving a family history of anxiety disorders.",
            "What is the prognosis (outlook) for megalophobia?": "Only about 10 to 25% of people who have a specific phobia seek treatment for their condition because many can avoid the object or situation that they fear. If you have megalophobia, avoiding situations that involve large objects can prevent you from enjoying certain things in life like traveling and can lower your overall quality of life. This is why it\u2019s important to seek treatment. Everyone deserves a high quality of life. Research has shown that exposure therapy is successful in treating megalophobia and other specific phobias. People who have a specific phobia, like megalophobia, and don\u2019t seek treatment are two times more likely to develop an anxiety disorder and depression.",
            "How can I take care of myself if I have megalophobia?": "It can be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider if you\u2019re experiencing the signs and symptoms of megalophobia. Therapy can help you overcome your megalophobia. If you\u2019ve already been diagnosed with megalophobia, there are some things you can do to manage your symptoms and feel well, including: Get enough sleep and exercise.\nIf you are participating in psychological therapy to treat your megalophobia, be sure to see your therapist regularly.\nPractice mindfulness activities such as mediation.\nPractice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and yoga.\nReach out to family and friends for support.\nConsider joining a support group for people who have megalophobia or specific phobias in general.",
            "What questions should I ask my doctor?": "Talking about your mental health can be uncomfortable and scary. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health, so it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms. The following questions may be helpful to ask your provider if you have megalophobia: What kind of treatment do you recommend?\nShould I see a therapist, psychologist and/or psychiatrist?\nDo you have any recommendations for psychologists, psychiatrists or therapists that I could see?\nHow long will treatment take?\nDo you know of any support groups for megalophobia or phobias in general?\nDo you have any learning resources on megalophobia that I could read? A note from Cleveland Clinic If you have megalophobia, know that you are not alone. Many people all over the world have a phobia. Avoiding large objects can provide short-term relief, but this doesn\u2019t address the underlying cause of your fear and anxiety. Although it can be difficult and uncomfortable, it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider and seek proper treatment for your megalophobia. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you can take back control of your life. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 08/20/2021. Eaton WW, Bienvenu, OJ, Miloyan B.
