The fear of being touched becomes a phobia when symptoms: Develop nearly every time you are touched. \nInterfere with your day-to-day life and relationships. \nLast six months or longer.",
            "How is haphephobia diagnosed?": "To diagnose haphephobia, your healthcare provider may ask you about: When fear arises. \nHow long fear has lasted. \nWhat symptoms you experience when you think about being touched. \nWhat symptoms you experience when you are touched. \nIf symptoms interfere with your daily activities or relationships.",
            "How is haphephobia treated?": "Treatment for haphephobia aims to help you manage symptoms so they do not interfere with your life. Common haphephobia treatment options include: Exposure therapy: With this treatment, you gradually introduce a specific fear into your thoughts or life. For example, you may imagine receiving a touch on the arm from a trusted loved one. Over time, you may practice receiving the touch in person. Exposure therapy is often the first treatment for a specific phobia. The therapy is successful for about 90% of people who stick with it. \nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR is often effective for people who have experienced trauma. During therapy, you focus on a traumatic memory while being stimulated by specific rhythmic movements. EMDR can help you process and move on from a traumatic event. \nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): During CBT, you speak with a therapist about symptoms and fears. The therapist helps you identify irrational thoughts and learn to replace them with rational ones. For phobias, CBT is often part of a larger treatment plan and not a standalone therapy. \nHypnotherapy: With hypnotherapy, a therapist guides you to a place of intense focus. You become temporarily unaware of your surroundings and are more open to new thoughts or suggestions. You may have hypnotherapy with other types of therapy.\nMedication: You may take medicines for anxiety disorders or for specific phobias. For example, your doctor may prescribe alprazolam (Xanax\u00ae) or diazepam (Valium\u00ae) to take before certain events. These medicines may help you temporarily manage symptoms to avoid panic attacks.",

            "How can I reduce my risk of haphephobia?": "There is no one way to prevent haphephobia. But many people can reduce the frequency and intensity of phobia symptoms with healthy lifestyle habits. You may: Eat a nutritious diet full of lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats.\nManage other mental health conditions, such as OCD or PTSD, with the help of a trusted healthcare provider.\nSleep at least seven to eight hours nightly.\nTalk with trusted loved ones or a therapist to prevent social isolation.",

            "What else should I ask my doctor?": "You may also want to ask your healthcare provider: What is the most likely cause of haphephobia? \nWhat can I do to manage haphephobia symptoms? \nIs haphephobia related to another mental health diagnosis? \nWould I benefit from taking medication? \nWill haphephobia symptoms ever go away completely?",
            "Is haphephobia related to autism?": "Many people with autism don\u2019t like to be touched. Some research has found that the brain of a person with autism responds to physical touch the same way a person with haphephobia does. Not everyone with autism has haphephobia, and having haphephobia doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have autism. However, studies show that about half of all people with autism also have an anxiety disorder. Of that half, up to two in three have a specific phobia, which could include haphephobia. People with autism also commonly experience bullying or abuse, which can lead to haphephobia. A note from Cleveland ClinicHaphephobia is the fear of being touched. For some people, the fear is specific to being touched by people of one gender. For others, the fear extends to all people. People with haphephobia often experience physical symptoms of intense distress when they are touched. They may feel nauseated, flushed or like their heart is racing. Treatment such as therapy or medication helps many people manage haphephobia symptoms and live a more comfortable life. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 10/22/2021.
