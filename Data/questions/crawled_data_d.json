These feelings may be worse if they\u2019ve had a bad experience with a dentist in the past.\nFeeling pain: Dental procedures fairly often involve a small amount of pain. And sometimes, the procedure or recovery does hurt. People who\u2019re highly sensitive to pain may be more fearful of feeling discomfort during their dental treatment or as a result of it.\nNeedles: People afraid of needles may fear the injections dentists use during dental procedures.\nNoise: Someone may fear the noise made by drills and dental instruments used by the dentist or dental hygienist.\nSmells: People may become anxious due to how the dentist\u2019s office smells or the specific aromas that arise during dental treatment.",
            "Who is at risk for dentophobia?": "You\u2019re more likely to develop a fear of dentists or a different type of specific phobia disorder if you already have: Another phobia.\nAnxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder.\nSubstance use disorder.",

Traumatic experiences may include being afraid of going to the dentist as a child, having dental procedures performed without your consent or having a procedure that caused pain or complications.\nTraumatic history: A history of abuse, such as bullying, child abuse or sexual violence, can lead to dentophobia.",
            "What are dentophobia triggers?": "Dentophobia triggers include: Being inside a dental office.\nHearing or seeing dental instruments.\nLying in a dentist\u2019s chair.\nSeeing a dentist or dental hygienist.\nThinking about a dental visit.",

            "How is dentophobia diagnosed?": "The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognizes dentophobia as a specific phobic disorder in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Your healthcare provider may diagnose dentophobia if you experience intense anxiety or fear when thinking about or visiting the dentist. Your dentist or healthcare provider may suggest that you see a mental health professional like a psychologist.

You may have this specific phobic disorder if your fear of dentists: Occurs when you think about visiting or go to visit the dentist.\nPrevents you from seeing a dentist, even when you\u2019re in pain or need urgent treatment.\nTriggers symptoms of anxiety or fear that don\u2019t match the actual danger.\nLasts at least six months. How can I find out if my child has dentophobia? A constant fear of the dentist can be extremely upsetting for your child. If your child is very young, it may be difficult for them to verbalize what\u2019s wrong. If severe fear of the dentist greatly impacts your child\u2019s life, your child\u2019s healthcare provider or dentist may recommend they visit a mental health professional. This healthcare provider can look at your child\u2019s symptoms, offer a diagnosis and help you form a treatment plan.",
            "What are dentophobia treatments?": "Exposure therapy is one of the main treatments for a fear of dentists. During exposure therapy, a mental health professional exposes you to situations and images that may trigger your symptoms.

CBT helps you change the way you see and respond to situations that trigger symptoms.\nDistraction: Dentists may offer music, movies or TV shows to help distract your mind from your dental treatment.\nGuided imagery: You can use relaxation, visualization and positive suggestion to create a sense of well-being. You think of the sights, sounds and smells of a place that\u2019s pleasing to you, such as a beach or the mountains.\nHypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help change your perception of situations. Studies have shown that hypnotherapy has helped people cope with stressful dental treatments.\nRelaxation techniques: Practicing deep breathing and muscle relaxation can help you lower stress and anxiety levels.\nSedation: Your dentist can provide sedation (medication) to help you relax during treatments. Medications may include nitrous oxide (laughing gas), pills taken orally or IV sedation (through a vein).",
            "What are the complications of dentophobia?": "Severe dentophobia often results in poor oral health when people don\u2019t visit the dentist. Poor oral health can lead to: Complications from diabetes.\nDecayed teeth.\nGum (periodontal) disease.\nHeart disease (coronary artery disease).\nMissing teeth.\nPneumonia and respiratory infections.",
            "How can dentophobia affect my well-being?": "Fear of dentists can also have a negative effect on your general well-being. People whose oral health has been impacted by dentophobia may become embarrassed about their teeth and avoid seeing friends or family. Dentophobia can also affect their performance at work or school. Due to these factors, dentophobia can spur: Aggression.\nLow self-esteem and self-confidence.\nSleep disorders.",
            "How can I best learn to cope with dentophobia during a dental visit?": "In addition to seeking long-term treatment if needed, you can try certain techniques to cope with dentophobia during a dental visit.

They may suggest calming medications or other techniques.\nBring a friend with you to offer support.\nChoose a dentist who listens to you and works with you to help reduce your anxiety. These dentists are known as fear-free dentists.\nCome up with a signal that tells your dentist to stop if you need a break during treatment.\nVisit your dentist at a less busy time of day, such as early in the morning, to limit the impact of noise from other patients\u2019 treatments.",
            "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you have: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: How long will I need therapy?\nShould I try exposure therapy?\nShould I look for signs of complications?\nWhat\u2019s causing this phobia?\nWhat\u2019s the most effective treatment for me?",
            "Is dentophobia real?": "Yes, dentophobia is a real phobia disorder that\u2019s recognized in the DSM. But even phobias not found in the DSM are real if they affect your life. People who have a fear of the dentist can use treatment and coping strategies to overcome their phobia.",
            "How can I find a dentist who understands dentophobia?": "To find a dentist who understands dentophobia, first get dentist suggestions from trusted friends and family members. Then, make an initial appointment with the dentist to discuss your fears. Based on the initial meeting, you\u2019ll need to evaluate if you feel comfortable with the dentist. It may take some trial and error to find a dentist who understands your situation. It\u2019s worth spending the time to find someone who\u2019ll help you feel less anxious during any treatments. A note from Cleveland Clinic Dentophobia (fear of dentists) can lead to untreated dental problems and poor oral health. This phobia can also affect your self-confidence and relationships. Healthcare providers and your dentist can help you overcome your fear of going to the dentist.
