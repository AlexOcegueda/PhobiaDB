# PhobiaDB
These are scripts I used to fill up my Postgres DB.

# MayoClinic
  - Taken from Fernando Diaz @fediazgon
  - I reworked it to return the data as a JSON file and to filter to phobias specifically.

# WikipediaPhobias
  - Containers a web scraper to retrieve a table of phobias along with their description.
  - Simply run python3 main.py while you are in the correct folder and it should return a JSON file
