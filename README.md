# PhobiaDB
These are scripts I used to fill up my Database with all the data I collected from the internet about phobias. Each scraper has its own documentation so check that out first before attempting to use them.

# DB
This contains main which will run the flask application containing a UI for all the phobias. The other scripts in this folder are used to fill up the database if something gets corrupted. 

# DBScripts
This contains both the questions and symptoms used to fill up their respected tables in the database.
