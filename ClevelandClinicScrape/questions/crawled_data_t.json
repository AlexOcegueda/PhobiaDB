        "What\u2019s the difference between thanatophobia and necrophobia?": "Thanatophobia is different than necrophobia. Necrophobia is a fear of dead things (corpses) or places that contain dead things, such as graveyards.",
        "Is thanatophobia normal?": "It\u2019s natural to feel some sense of worry about death or dying. After all, it\u2019s normal to fear the unknown. You might think dying will be scary, painful or lonely. But if you have thanatophobia, your fear of death affects your daily life. It may make it difficult to function at school, work or in social situations. You may experience physical symptoms, such as a panic attack, when you think about dying. Or you might go out of your way to avoid talking about death or the dying process.",
        "How common is thanatophobia?": "Research suggests that death anxiety is common, though people tend not to report their feelings. One study shows that between 3% and 10% of people feel they\u2019re more nervous than others about the thought of dying.",
        "Who is at risk for thanatophobia?": "Thanatophobia can affect adults and children. It\u2019s more common in people who: Are in poor health or receive a diagnosis of a serious illness.\nDon\u2019t have religious beliefs.\nFeel a sense of dissatisfaction with their life.\nHave low self-esteem.\nHave other phobias or mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety.\nHave parents or loved ones who are elderly, ill or dying.\nLack close family members or friends.\nWitness illness, trauma or violence in their jobs, such as healthcare providers or social workers.

        ],
        "How is thanatophobia diagnosed?": "There isn\u2019t a test for diagnosing thanatophobia. Your healthcare provider will carefully review your symptoms and ask a variety of questions about your fear of death. They rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or other anxiety disorders. Healthcare providers typically diagnose specific phobic disorders when: Symptoms last for six months or longer.\nSymptoms occur as soon as you encounter the feared object or situation.\nThe fear is about a specific object or situation, such as death or the dying process.\nYou go out of your way to avoid the object or situation you fear.\nYou have trouble functioning in your daily life due to your fear.",
        "How is thanatophobia managed or treated?": "If a fear of death affects your ability to function at school, work or in social situations, seek treatment from a healthcare provider. You may benefit from psychotherapy, which helps you talk through your fear and anxiety. Types of psychotherapy include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT can help you change the way you think about death so it isn\u2019t so scary. You may need to address unrealistic beliefs about death, such as feeling that death is \u201cunfair\u201d or that the dying process is always painful. CBT also gives you techniques to better manage how you react to thoughts of death, such as deep breathing.\nExposure therapy: This type of therapy gradually exposes you to places, thoughts or situations that relate to death. You might start by writing about how you picture your own death or the death of a loved one. Other exposure techniques could include visiting a hospital, writing a will, reading obituaries or talking with someone who has a terminal illness. Medication for thanatophobia or other specific phobic disorders hasn\u2019t proven very effective. But your healthcare provider may recommend anti-anxiety drugs if you have to be in a stressful or fearful situation, like a funeral.",
        "Is there a way to prevent thanatophobia?": "There\u2019s no way to prevent thanatophobia. But you can reduce its effects on your life by: Avoiding things that can make anxiety worse, like caffeine, drugs or alcohol.\nForming a supportive network of family members, friends and healthcare providers.\nGetting help as soon as you notice symptoms.",
        "What\u2019s the prognosis (outlook) for people with thanatophobia?": "Most people with thanatophobia respond very well to treatment. In fact, studies show that exposure therapy helps most people living with specific phobic disorders.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "Contact your healthcare provider if you experience: Difficulty functioning in your daily life due to fear of death or the dying process.\nSymptoms of a panic attack. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: Are there support groups for thanatophobia?\nHow long does psychotherapy last?\nWill my fear of death ever go away? A note from Cleveland Clinic Thanatophobia is an intense fear of death or the dying process. While it\u2019s natural to feel anxious about death from time to time, thanatophobia is an anxiety disorder that can disrupt every aspect of your life.

You may: Avoid watching the needle stick or looking at the needle itself.\nBring a support person, like a spouse, friend or family member, to medical appointments.\nDistract yourself by wiggling your toes, looking intently at a pattern on the wall or chatting with someone during the needle stick.\nLie down before getting a needle stick, especially if you have fainted or felt dizzy in the past.\nPractice deep-breathing techniques, such as counting to four on each inhale and exhale.\nRelax the muscle where you're receiving an injection to decrease pain.\nRequest a numbing agent such as a freezing spray to numb your skin before the needle prick.\nTell the person giving you an injection or blood draw that you have a fear of needles.",
        "Are there other conditions that put me at higher risk?": "You may be more likely to develop needle phobia if you have another mental health diagnosis, such as: Germaphobia.\nHypochondria.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
        "Are there long-term effects from trypanophobia?": "Untreated trypanophobia can have severe consequences. The fear may cause you to delay or forego necessary medical care. If you have a chronic health condition, avoiding medical care can significantly increase your risk of health complications. In medical emergencies, delaying or avoiding medical care can even lead to death. With treatment, many people can manage trypanophobia symptoms. Therapy or medication may help decrease anxiety enough that you can receive medical treatment.",
        "What should I ask my doctor?": "You might want to ask your healthcare provider: What is the most likely cause of trypanophobia? \nWhat can I do to relax before medical appointments? \nWhat are the available treatments for trypanophobia? \nCan I overcome trypanophobia?",
        "How do I know if I have trypanophobia?": "If you feel extreme anxiety every time you see a needle or think about an injection, you may have trypanophobia. Often, people with this phobia have symptoms when they know they need to get an injection or blood draw. They may feel dizziness, nausea or heart palpitations. Typically, needles are the only trigger for this fear. If you have extreme anxiety symptoms at other times, your symptoms may relate to another condition. A note from Cleveland Clinic Trypanophobia is the extreme fear of needles. Specifically, people with this phobia feel afraid of getting injections or blood draws. Although trypanophobia is common, it can significantly interfere with your life. People with intense needle phobia may delay or avoid necessary medical care. With treatment, you can learn to manage anxiety symptoms so that you experience fewer disruptions to your life. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 04/12/2022.

        "name": "Trypophobia",
        "description": "Trypophobia brings on feelings of disgust or fear when you see patterns with lots of holes. Sunflowers, honeycombs, sponges and seedy fruits can cause this response. Trypophobia is a type of anxiety disorder. Most people don\u2019t have a true fear of holes. Exposure therapy may help you manage repulsions to holey patterns.",
        "What is trypophobia?": "Trypophobia (trip-uh-FOE-bee-uh) is an aversion or repulsion to objects like honeycombs and sponges that have repetitive patterns or clusters of small holes. People with trypophobia are disgusted by the pattern of holes. They don\u2019t necessarily have a fear of holes.",
        "What are trypophobia triggers?": "A person is more likely to have an adverse reaction to a holey object or image the closer they are to it. Trypophobia triggers may include: Bread and bagels with seeds.\nCheese with holes.\nFruits with small seeds like strawberries, raspberries, papaya and kiwi.\nHoneycombs, sunflowers and lotus seed pods.\nInsects and bees.\nSkin on snakes, lizards, frogs and other reptiles.\nSoles of shoes.\nSponges.",
        "How common is trypophobia?": "Some studies suggest that as many as 17% of children and adults (about one in six people) have some degree of trypophobia. It\u2019s a fairly new disorder first named in 2005. More people became aware of trypophobia after news stories reported that people reacted negatively to clusters of tiny camera lenses on certain smartphones. In addition, the TV show \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d featured a character who had trypophobia. The show included triggering images that repulsed some viewers and increased awareness of the phobia.",
        "What causes trypophobia?": "Experts don\u2019t know why some people develop trypophobia. One theory is that the brain associates clusters of holes with danger. For example, you may associate a pattern of small holes with the skin of a venomous snake or the eyes of a tarantula. Or the holes may remind you of skin diseases or skin rashes. Another theory is that your brain uses more energy and oxygen to process holey patterns, triggering feelings of distress. It may also be a feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",
        "How do you get trypophobia?": "Trypophobia affects more females than males. You may be more prone to trypophobia if you have: Anxiety.\nDepression.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.",
        "What are trypophobia symptoms?": [
            "trypophobia cause chills choking dry mouth fast breathing heart rate intense feeling disgust terror pale skin profuse sweating hyperhidrosis nausea trembling shaking"
        ],
        "How is trypophobia diagnosed?": "The American Psychiatric Association (APA) doesn\u2019t recognize trypophobia as a disorder in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This may be because the condition is often uncomfortable but not debilitating. Because it\u2019s not recognized as a disorder, there aren\u2019t established criteria for diagnosing it. However, there is a trypophobia test. Completing the online trypophobia test (which is solely for research purposes) may help determine whether you have this aversion. The test doesn\u2019t collect your personal information. Your participation is anonymous. The trypophobia test: Displays a variety of images for one to eight seconds each. Some of the images have patterns or clusters of holes, while some do not.\nAsks you to estimate how long you saw each image.\nCompares your estimates for viewing trypophobic images and neutral images (those without holes) and gives you a ratio at the end of the test. A ratio higher than two may indicate trypophobia. You may want to talk to a mental health professional like a psychologist about the test findings and your adverse reactions to holey patterns.",
        "Is there a trypophobia cure?": "If trypophobia affects your ability to engage in certain activities or enjoy life, you may benefit from exposure therapy. This therapy gradually exposes you to trypophobia triggers, helping you to manage your reactions. This type of psychotherapy (talk therapy) helps as many as nine in 10 people overcome specific phobic disorders. During exposure therapy, your healthcare provider: Teaches you breathing and relaxation techniques to use before and during exposures.\nShows you images or videos of clusters or patterns of holes while helping you manage your response.\nGradually expands the exposures until you are touching or holding something with a holey pattern, like a sponge. You may also get cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This therapy helps change your perceptions and responses to situations that trigger trypophobia. Anti-anxiety medications generally don\u2019t help people with specific phobic disorders. If you know you\u2019ll be in a situation that might trigger a reaction, your provider may prescribe anti-anxiety medicine for short-term help.",
        "What are the complications of trypophobia?": "In extreme situations, trypophobia may affect your ability to work, go to school or socialize. You may experience: Depression.\nIncreased stress and irritability.\nInsomnia or sleep problems.\nPanic attacks.",
        "Can you prevent trypophobia?": "Relaxation techniques like meditation, mindfulness or visualizing soothing images may help you avoid feelings of trypophobia.",
        "What is the prognosis (outlook) for people who have trypophobia?": "Most people who complete exposure therapy see improvements in their symptoms. Once you have a handle on trypophobia triggers, you can use breathing or relaxation methods to manage your body\u2019s reactions.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: Depression, anxiety or OCD.\nExtreme irritability.\nInsomnia\nPanic attacks.",
        "What questions should I ask my doctor?": "You may want to ask your healthcare provider: What causes trypophobia?\nWhat is the best treatment for me?\nShould I try exposure therapy?\nHow long will I need therapy?\nShould I watch for signs of complications? A note from Cleveland Clinic Trypophobia refers to disgust or fear of a pattern of holes. Seeing clusters of holes in foods, flowers and everyday items like sponges can trigger feelings of revulsion. Trypophobia is gaining recognition as an anxiety problem that can affect quality of life. Don\u2019t be embarrassed to talk to your healthcare provider if you think you have trypophobia. (You can take the trypophobia test to find out.) If needed, your provider can connect you with a mental health professional who may use exposure therapy to help you overcome this issue.
