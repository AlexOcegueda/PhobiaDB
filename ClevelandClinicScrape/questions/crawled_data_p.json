        "name": "Papyrophobia (Fear of Paper)",
        "description": "Papyrophobia causes a fear of paper. You may panic when you see paper or have to touch or write on paper. You may also be afraid of getting a paper cut. This phobia can negatively affect your quality of life, as many everyday items are made of paper. Exposure therapy or other psychotherapies can help you overcome a fear of paper.",
        "What is papyrophobia?": "People who have papyrophobia have an illogical fear of paper. The Greek word \u201cpapyro\u201d and the Egyptian word \u201cpapyrus\u201d mean paper. \u201cPhobos\u201d is the Greek word for fear. A person with papyrophobia may be afraid to touch paper or write on it. They may also worry about getting a paper cut.",
        "What do people with papyrophobia fear?": "Someone with papyrophobia may fear: Any type of paper, including wallpaper, newspaper and wrapping paper.\nSeeing or touching paper.\nWriting on paper.\nPaper cuts.\nThe sound of someone crumpling paper.\nExtra-large pieces of paper.\nCurrency bills or money.\nTouching bills or receipts.",
        "How common is papyrophobia?": "It\u2019s hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like papyrophobia, but it\u2019s rare. We do know that about 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives, though. People who are fearful about germs may also have a fear of touching paper. This fear could be more common these days due to concerns about catching SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There\u2019s no evidence of anyone getting sick with the coronavirus from handling paper or money but we should always follow disease-prevention guidelines. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after contact with money or receipts.",
        "What causes papyrophobia?": "People designated females at birth (DFAB) are more likely than those designated male at birth (DMAB) to experience a phobia disorder. Risk factors include: Family history: Witnessing a parent or loved one struggle with a phobia or anxiety disorder may make you more likely to have the same fears.\nGenetics: Some research suggests that some people have gene change that makes them more prone to anxiety disorders and phobias.\nOther phobias: It\u2019s common to have more than one phobia.",
        "What other phobias are associated with fear of paper?": "Many people have several phobias. These fears often are interrelated. For instance, someone who has a fear of paper may also have: Chrometophobia (fear of money), especially paper money.\nCogombophobia (fear of cardboard boxes).\nHemophobia (fear of blood, which a paper cut can cause).\nMysophobia or germophobia (fear of germs).\nDendrophobia (fear of trees).",
        "What are the symptoms of papyrophobia?": [
            "people phobias may realize extreme fear still physical symptoms encounter phobia trigger case paper symptoms may include dizziness dry mouth extreme feeling dread terror nausea vomiting diarrhea profuse sweating rapid breathing heart rate shaking trembling shortness breath"
        ],
        "How is papyrophobia diagnosed?": "The American Psychiatric Association doesn\u2019t recognize fear of paper as a phobic disorder in its diagnostic manual (the DSM-5). However, a psychologist or another healthcare provider can evaluate your symptoms to diagnose this phobia. Criteria for a specific phobic disorder diagnosis include: Severe fear or anxiety when you think about or touch paper.\nOngoing fear of paper that lasts for at least six months.\nSymptoms that arise anytime you touch or think about paper.\nTaking steps to avoid coming into contact with or seeing paper.\nReduced quality of life due to phobia symptoms.",
        "What is papyrophobia treatment?": "There are several ways that a mental health professional can help you overcome a fear of paper, including: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a form of psychotherapy (talk therapy) that helps you process why you have fears about paper. Your healthcare provider uses this knowledge to help you change your perceptions and responses.\nExposure therapy: This psychotherapy makes you less afraid of the feared object (paper). Therapy gradually exposes you to images and situations involving paper. You may start by looking at paper and progress to holding and writing on paper. This is desensitization, and it works for most people with specific phobias.\nDialectal behavior therapy (DBT): This approach teaches you coping skills and relaxation techniques like meditation that can help you manage phobia symptoms. You work one-on-one with a therapist to learn these skills. You may also practice your new skills in supportive group therapy sessions.\nHypnotherapy: This therapy induces a hypnotic, trance-like state to help you uncover the root cause of the phobia. Most healthcare providers combine hypnotherapy with psychotherapy to help you address and overcome the fear.\nMedications: Anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants can ease symptoms. These medicines can help you get through day-to-day activities that often involve contact with paper. You may not need the medicine once other therapies start showing results.",
        "What are the complications of papyrophobia?": "An extreme fear of paper may cause a panic attack. You may feel like you\u2019re having a heart attack and are at risk of dying. What you\u2019re experiencing is a severe physical response to the phobia trigger. Repeated panic attacks can lead to panic disorder. Anti-anxiety medicines and other therapies can help. A fear of paper can make it difficult, sometimes impossible, to function in society or hold down a job. An extreme fear of paper may make you afraid to leave your home or other places that you consider safe. You may develop another phobia called agoraphobia that causes you to avoid going places where you might see or have contact with paper. Your loved ones may have a difficult time understanding this fear. As a result, you may be at risk for: Social isolation and depression.\nSubstance use disorder.\nSuicidal thoughts.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping.\nSigns of depression or problems with substances. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: What\u2019s causing this phobia?\nWhat\u2019s the best treatment for me?\nShould I try exposure therapy?\nHow long will I need therapy?\nCan medications help? A note from Cleveland Clinic Many things are made of paper: money, mail, tickets, receipts and more. Going through life without having to see or touch paper at some point isn\u2019t realistic or healthy. A fear of paper, or papyrophobia, can affect your ability to work and enjoy life. If you develop this rare specific phobic disorder, a mental health specialist can help you overcome the fear. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 03/15/2022.

        "name": "Pedophobia (Fear of Children)",
        "description": "A traumatic experience involving an infant or child may cause pedophobia, a fear of small children. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or mysophobia (fear of germs) may be more at risk. You may get anxious or fearful when you see children or are around them. Exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you overcome pedophobia.",
        "What is pedophobia?": "People with pedophobia develop an irrational fear of babies and small children. The word pedophobia stems from \u201cpaida,\u201d the Greek word for children. \u201cPhobos\u201d is the Greek word for fear. Someone who has pedophobia may take extreme measures to avoid being around small children. Even the thought of being near children can cause anxiety and fear.",
        "How many people have pedophobia?": "It\u2019s hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia disorder like pedophobia. Many people may keep this fear to themselves or may not recognize they have it. We do know that about 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives, though.",
        "What is the difference between pedophobia and pediophobia?": "It can be easy to confuse these two phobias, which have similar spellings. Pediophobia is a fear of dolls or inanimate objects that look real, and pedophobia is a fear of actual children. People can suffer from both phobias, so someone who fears children (pedophobia) may also fear the childlike features of dolls (pediophobia), and someone with pediophobia may also have pedophobia.",
        "Who is at risk for pedophobia?": "People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who need things to be neat and orderly may develop specific phobias, like pedophobia. They may view children as messy and disruptive. They fear the chaos that often comes with being around small children. Certain factors increase your risk for developing a specific phobic disorder: Gender: Women are more likely to have a phobia than men.\nFamily history: Growing up with a parent or loved one who has a phobia or anxiety disorder may predispose you to the same fears or a different phobia.\nGenetics: Some studies suggest that a genetic change (like a gene mutation) may make people more likely to have an anxiety or phobic disorder.",
        "What other phobias are associated with pedophobia?": "Having more than one phobia is common. Phobias are often tied together. For instance, someone with a fear of germs (mysophobia or germaphobia) may view children as tiny germ carriers and develop pedophobia. And someone who fears young children may also develop a fear of teenagers (ephebiphobia).",
        "What causes pedophobia?": "A harmful or negative experience with an infant or child might cause you to fear children. That bad experience could happen during childhood or adulthood. You may have a direct experience or witness an event, such as: Child abuse.\nBullying, humiliation, violence or extreme temper tantrums by a child.\nDeath of an infant or child.\nPregnancy loss, such as a miscarriage or stillbirth.",
        "What do people with pedophobia fear?": "Pedophobia affects everyone differently. You may be: Able to be around children you know, such as relatives, but not other children.\nUnable to be around any children without experiencing panicky symptoms.\nAnxious just thinking about being near children or seeing visual images of them.\nAfraid or worried about any situation that puts you near children.",

        ],
        "How is pedophobia diagnosed?": "The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) helps mental health professionals like psychologists diagnose phobia disorders based on symptoms and how the symptoms impact your quality of life. Healthcare providers use these criteria to diagnose a specific phobic disorder like philophobia: Intense fear of infants and small children that persists for at least six months.\nSymptoms that start as soon as you\u2019re near children or simply think about being around children.\nExtreme fear or anxiety that makes you avoid situations where you might be near infants or children.\nSymptoms that affect your quality of life.\nIntense feelings of fear, anxiety or dread that don\u2019t match the real danger.",
        "What are ways to treat pedophobia?": "A mental health professional can help you overcome the fear of being around small children. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) often works for people with pedophobia. Treatments may include: Exposure therapy (desensitization): You slowly face your fear of babies and small children through gradually increasing exposure to images or situations that involve children. The goal is to desensitize you to the fear through repeated exposure. Most people with specific phobias see symptom improvement with exposure therapy over time.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This therapy helps you analyze why you fear children. CBT helps address traumatic events that may have led to this fear. After you discover the cause, you learn how to change your perceptions and responses to situations involving children.\nMedications: Anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants may help while you\u2019re getting psychotherapy. These medicines ease symptoms, making it easier to be around children.",
        "What are the complications of pedophobia?": "An extreme fear of children can make it difficult to function in society. You may miss out on social events, struggle at work and develop depression. Some people have panic attacks, which feel a lot like a heart attack. Your heart may race, and you may have noncardiac chest pain. Anti-anxiety medications will help you to cope while you work on ways to make the fear less intense.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping.\nSigns of depression.\nSubstance use problems. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: What\u2019s causing this phobia?\nWhat\u2019s the best treatment for me?\nShould I try exposure therapy?\nHow long will I need therapy? A note from Cleveland Clinic Children are everywhere: in grocery stores and neighborhoods, on buses and sidewalks. It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid seeing these youngsters. Having a fear of infants and small children can make it difficult for you to shop, travel, socialize, attend gatherings and do things most people enjoy. Avoiding children altogether isn\u2019t realistic or healthy. A mental health professional can use psychotherapies like exposure therapy and CBT to help you overcome pedophobia.

Potential philophobia causes include: Previous difficult relationships: Children who experience their parents\u2019 argumentative divorce, parental death, abandonment or child abuse may find it difficult to feel love for others. The same holds true for adults who experience infidelity, divorce, abuse or abandonment.\nFear of rejection or abandonment: Having a parent leave you as a child can lead to a fear of love. Adults who experience repeat rejections from partners or friends may become afraid to love.\nCultural or religious pressures: Certain cultures arrange marriages without much (if any) consideration about love.

        "name": "Phobias",
        "description": "A phobia is when you have intense or even overpowering fear and anxiety in certain situations or when you encounter certain objects. While phobias can involve the same things as ordinary fears, the effects of phobias are more severe. In the most severe cases, people with phobias critically limit their lives to avoid encountering what they fear.",
        "How many different phobias are there?": "Because phobias, including the feelings of fear or anxiety they cause, affect everyone differently, there\u2019s no set number of fears. However, experts group fears into five main categories: CategoryExamples of phobiasAnimals.Alligators, dogs, snakes.Natural environment.Heights, storms, water.Blood, medical procedures or injuries.Needles, sharp objects, pain.Situations.Driving, flying, enclosed spaces.Other.Children, choking, clowns. Some of the most common phobias, by category, include: AnimalsNatural environmentBlood, medical procedures or injuriesSituationsOtherArachnophobia (Fear of Spiders).Acrophobia (Fear of Heights).Algophobia (Fear of Pain).Aerophobia (Fear of Flying).Coulrophobia (Fear of Clowns).Cynophobia (Fear of Dogs).Agoraphobia (Fear of Public Spaces).Dentophobia (Fear of Dentists).Amaxophobia (Fear of Driving).Emetophobia (Fear of vomiting).Entomophobia (Fear of Insects).Aquaphobia (Fear of Water).Hemophobia (Fear of Blood).Claustrophobia (Fear of Enclosed Spaces).Pyrophobia (Fear of Fire).Ophidiophobia (Fear of Snakes).Astraphobia (Fear of Thunder and Lightning).Trypanophobia (Fear of Needles).Nyctophobia (Fear of the Dark).Trypophobia (Fear of Clusters or Groups of Holes). Agoraphobia is a separate diagnosis because it can have many potential triggers. A diagnosis of agoraphobia requires that you experience multiple types of triggers. The five all relate to being in public areas or spaces.",
        "How common are phobias?": "While it\u2019s common for people to describe having a strong fear of something \u2014 like snakes or heights \u2014 that\u2019s not the same as a phobia. In reality, phobias aren\u2019t very common. The rates for specific phobia can vary by age. However, most people develop them before age 10. Overall: Only about 8% to 12% of people in the U.S. meet the criteria for specific phobia. Everywhere else in the world, it\u2019s between 2% and 6%.\nChildren: Worldwide, between 3% and 9% of children meet the requirements for specific phobia. Among teenagers (between 13 and 17 years) in the U.S., about 16% have it.\nOlder adults (65 and older): Specific phobia rates tend to decrease as people age. Estimates range between 3% and 5% for people 65 and older. Women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) are twice as likely to have specific phobia than men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB).",

        ],
        "What causes phobias?": "Phobias are when your brain takes fear and anxiety to extreme degrees. Under ordinary circumstances, these emotions can be protective and helpful. They\u2019re your brain\u2019s way of warning you that something is wrong and you might be (or currently are) in danger. But experts don\u2019t fully understand why these emotions can turn into phobias. However, several factors and processes may contribute to having a phobia. These include: Traumatic experiences. These can be experiences that happen to you or that you see happen to someone else.\nGenetics. Certain types of phobias are more likely to happen in people who have a relative with that type of phobia. The types with higher rates in family members are animal, blood/medical procedure/injury and situational phobias.\nInformational transmission. Some phobias may happen because of things you learn about or things you see or hear repeatedly.\nLearned fears. People can learn about the phobias or fears of others and may develop a phobia as a result. This may be a factor in why people with overprotective parents may be more likely to have specific phobia.",
        "What are the complications of phobias?": "Phobias can have long-term effects on your mental and physical health, especially when you frequently encounter triggers or have especially severe effects. People with specific phobia and agoraphobia have a higher risk of certain mental health conditions. While phobias may not cause those conditions, phobias usually start before the other conditions and can contribute to them. Mental health conditions that are more likely in people with specific phobia or agoraphobia include: Anxiety disorders.\nBipolar disorder.\nDepressive disorders.\nPersonality disorders (especially dependent personality disorder).\nSubstance use disorders.\nSomatic symptom disorders. Physical health conditions that commonly happen along with phobias or that may get worse because of phobia symptoms include: Heart disease.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nParkinson\u2019s disease.\nBalance and dizziness symptoms, which can also cause falls and fall-related injuries.\nDegenerative brain disorders and dementia symptoms.",
        "How are phobias diagnosed?": "A mental health provider, usually a psychologist or psychiatrist, can diagnose specific phobia or agoraphobia by talking to you and asking questions. Diagnosing these conditions doesn\u2019t require lab, imaging or diagnostic testing. The questions they ask may follow specific questionnaires designed to help diagnose a phobia. The questions they ask can include, but aren\u2019t limited to: Phobia triggers that you know about.\nWhat symptoms you experience and how severe they are.\nYour current lifestyle and routine and if phobia symptoms affect it.\nWhen the symptoms started.\nIf you have a history of a traumatic event or other possible factors that could cause or contribute to a phobia. Your provider will ask these questions because diagnosing specific phobia or agoraphobia requires that your symptoms meet certain criteria. You experience strong fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation.\nEncountering a phobia trigger causes immediate fear, anxiety or both.\nYou actively avoid phobia triggers, or experience intense fear, anxiety or both, when you encounter triggers you can\u2019t avoid.\nThe fear or anxiety you experience is much more severe than the trigger should cause.\nYou experience fear or anxiety from triggers or work to avoid them for at least six months.\nThe fear, anxiety or avoiding phobia triggers disrupts part of your life, including work, social relationships, etc.\nThe symptoms you experience aren\u2019t better explained by another condition (such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or panic disorder).",
        "How are phobias treated, and can they be cured?": "Treating phobias can involve mental health therapy (the formal term is \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d), medications or a combination of the two. The treatments can depend on the type of phobia you experience, how severe the symptoms are, and factors related to your lifestyle, routine and preferences. A healthcare provider can tell you more about the possible treatments that can help you and which they recommend. One of the main ways to treat a phobia is by helping you adjust your thinking and behaviors surrounding your fear. Mental health therapy (psychotherapy) is one of the most useful ways to do this. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of therapy that helps with this. Over time, therapy can help you better cope with the fear and anxiety you experience. Another treatment approach is exposure therapy. That can happen in two main ways: Systematic desensitization (graded exposure). This involves gradually exposing you to parts of triggers slowly. Over time, your provider will help you work through parts of your fears from least to most troubling. It also helps you practice adjusting your thinking and behaviors to manage feelings of fear and anxiety.\nFlooding. This technique is similar to desensitization, but it involves exposing you to the phobia triggers themselves, not in small bits over time. That helps you adjust to triggers and control your anxiety. Though less common, this technique can sometimes help people with phobias (but most providers recommend using it cautiously). Exposure therapy can happen in two ways: In vivo. From Latin, and in this context means, \u201cin real life.\u201d Exposing yourself to your fear in real life is one way that you can work through it.\nImaginal. This is where your provider has you imagine your fear and helps you process and work through the fear by thinking about it. For some phobias, this is the only way to use exposure therapy, especially phobias that would be dangerous to be around in real life. In some cases, certain medications can also help you with phobia symptoms. These are usually depression medications or anxiety medications. Many types of medications can help with phobia symptoms, so your healthcare provider is the best person to explain your options and which they recommend. They can also explain the possible side effects, complications and other details you should know about these drugs.",
        "Are phobias preventable?": "Phobias happen unpredictably, and they can vary widely from one person to another. That\u2019s partly because fear is something that each person experiences differently. Because of that, there\u2019s no way to prevent phobias from developing. There\u2019s also no known way to reduce your risk of developing them.",
        "What can I expect if I have a phobia?": "Phobias can majorly impact your mental health and well-being, especially if they involve something you encounter often. About 75% of people with specific phobia also have more than one type of phobia, which can make this condition very disruptive. Over time, untreated phobias can cause some people to limit their lives severely. Over time, specific phobia can fade. However, this is less likely to happen without treatment. Phobias that start in childhood may fade quickly. But childhood phobias that last into adulthood can last for years or even decades.",
        "What\u2019s the outlook for phobias?": "The outlook for specific phobia is best with treatment, especially early on. Without treatment, these conditions can greatly impact your mental health and how you live your life. Early treatment for phobia symptoms can make a major difference, even if you don\u2019t have an official phobia diagnosis because you haven\u2019t had symptoms for at least six months. This is true no matter what your age or what phobia you have.",
        "How do I take care of myself if I have a phobia?": "The most important things you can do if you think you have a phobia include: Seek help. You should seek help as soon as you notice phobia symptoms disrupting your life. Getting help sooner can make a big difference in your recovery.\nFollow treatment guidance. If your healthcare provider prescribes medication or recommends regular mental health visits, following them can make your treatment more effective and help you faster.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the value of lifestyle changes. Staying active, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol and nonmedical use of drugs, and managing your stress and mental health can all help you as you work on managing or overcoming a phobia. Phobias can increase your risk of anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions. Those conditions can, in turn, increase your risk of self-harm or suicide. You should get immediate help if you have thoughts about harming yourself or others, or if you suspect someone you know is in danger of harming themselves. Resources that can help you include: National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (United States). This line can help you if you have suicidal thoughts or impulses, and you can also call even when you\u2019re not in crisis. To call this line, dial 988. You can also receive help via text message. To do so, text HELLO to 741741.\n911 (or your local emergency services number). You should call 911 (or the local emergency services number) if you feel like you are (or someone you know is) in immediate danger of self-harm or suicide. Operators and dispatchers for 911 lines can often help people in immediate danger because of a severe mental crisis and send first responders to assist. A note from Cleveland Clinic You might feel that having a phobia is a major flaw or a sign of weakness, but it isn\u2019t. Phobias are widespread and can affect everyone, regardless of age or background. Just as there\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking treatment for a broken bone or an ear infection, there\u2019s nothing wrong with seeing a mental health professional for help with a phobia. If you have or think you might have a phobia, talk to a mental health provider. With treatment, you can find ways to manage \u2014 or even overcome \u2014 your fears. That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about what you might encounter the next time you go out your door. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 02/22/2023.

        "name": "Phobophobia (Fear of Fear)",
        "description": "Phobophobia is an intense fear of being afraid. Some people might be terrified of the physical symptoms that come with fear, such as rapid breathing or dizziness. Others are scared of developing another phobic disorder. You may need psychotherapy or medication as treatment.",
        "What is phobophobia?": "Phobophobia is an extreme fear of being afraid. While this condition may sound redundant, it\u2019s a very real and complex disorder that can take a few forms. A person with phobophobia may be scared of the physical sensations that come with fear, such as shortness of breath, sweaty palms or heart palpitations. They might feel that these symptoms threaten their life or have the potential to cause permanent damage. Or they may have a fear of developing a specific phobia, such as claustrophobia (fear of crowded, confined spaces) or trypanophobia (fear of needles). The anxiety of anticipating a potential phobia actually becomes a phobia itself. Many experts refer to this as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Phobophobia, like other phobias, can affect every aspect of a person\u2019s life. Intense feelings of dread, anxiety and panic can make it difficult to function at work, school or in social situations.",
        "How common is phobophobia?": "It\u2019s hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like phobophobia, but it\u2019s rare. We do know that about 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives, though. These disorders are about twice as common in women as they are in men.",
        "What causes phobophobia?": "Phobophobia may have several causes, including: Family history: Research suggests that phobias may have a genetic component. This means you inherit an abnormal gene (or multiple genes) from your parents. These genes increase your risk of developing a phobia, anxiety disorder or other mental health disorder.\nOther phobias: Many people with phobophobia may already have one or more phobias. Anxiety about their fear (not necessarily the feared object) prevents them from getting effective treatment. So, if someone has severe ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), they\u2019re very afraid of actual snakes. A person with phobophobia may even be more scared of the feelings of fear that they get around snakes than of the snakes themselves.\nTrauma: If you witnessed someone having a panic attack or experiencing severe symptoms of fear, you may be scared that the same could happen to you. Or perhaps you had a terrifying experience in the past and remember the trauma and physical symptoms of the fear itself more than the thing or situation that frightened you.",

        "How is phobophobia diagnosed?": "Your healthcare provider may diagnose you with phobophobia if you: Avoid any situation where you might get scared.\nFind it difficult to function in your daily life due to your fear.\nHave symptoms of phobophobia for six months or longer. Many people with phobophobia have other phobias, so this can make it a difficult condition to diagnose. Your healthcare provider will try to identify each phobia separately to build the most effective treatment plan. People with phobophobia may also have other mental health disorders, such as: Avoidant personality disorder.\nIllness anxiety disorder (hypochondria).\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nPanic disorder.\nParanoid personality disorder.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
        "How is phobophobia managed or treated?": "Treatment for phobophobia may include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): During CBT, which is a form of psychotherapy (talk therapy), you learn to change negative behavior and thinking about the thing you fear. If you have phobophobia, your therapist may teach you to identify specific things that trigger your fear. Then, you learn techniques for managing your reaction, such as deep breathing or meditation.\nExposure therapy: Your healthcare provider may recommend exposure therapy along with CBT. You gradually encounter the things that trigger your fear. You may be asked to recreate the symptoms of fear or panic in a controlled environment. Over time, you become desensitized to those fears and your symptoms diminish.\nMedication: Medication isn\u2019t very effective for treating phobias, but you may need it to manage co-existing mental health disorders such as anxiety, panic disorder or PTSD. If medication helps reduce the frequency and severity of anxiety or panic attacks, it may also diminish phobophobia.",
        "Is there a way to prevent phobophobia?": "It\u2019s difficult to prevent phobias, but you can take steps to reduce stress and anxiety in your life: Avoid caffeine, drugs, alcohol or other substances that make anxiety worse.\nBuild a strong support system of friends and family members.\nEat a balanced diet and stay active.\nPrioritize hobbies or activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\nReach out to your healthcare provider if your fear becomes unmanageable.",
        "What\u2019s the prognosis (outlook) for people with phobophobia?": "CBT and exposure therapy help most people manage specific phobic disorders. Medications may be helpful while you work on other therapies.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "Contact your healthcare provider if you experience: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with your daily life or sleeping.\nSigns of depression or substance use problems. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: How can I overcome phobophobia?\nHow long will I need treatment?\nWhat treatments are available? A note from Cleveland Clinic Phobophobia is a fear of being afraid. You might be scared of the physical symptoms that come with fear, or feel worried that you could develop a phobia.

Someone with podophobia may experience severe anxiety when they see or think about their own feet or other people\u2019s feet. Their fear might focus on bare feet, but it can also apply to feet covered in shoes and socks. Podophobia can have a serious effect on a person\u2019s quality of life. Your feet are with you all the time, so if you fear your own feet, you might have a constant sense of worry or panic. If you\u2019re scared of other people\u2019s feet, it can be hard to function at work, in social situations or in public.",
        "Why do I find feet disgusting?": "A lot of people think feet are gross. Feet can be smelly or dirty, and you can\u2019t wash them as often as you wash your hands. They can develop fungus or infections. Common foot problems include toenail fungus and athlete\u2019s foot. But it\u2019s important to note that finding feet disgusting isn\u2019t the same as having podophobia. People with podophobia see feet as threatening and potentially harmful.",
        "How common is podophobia?": "There\u2019s no data on podophobia specifically, but phobias as a whole are fairly common. Research shows that about 12% of adults and 19% of teenagers in the U.S. have a specific phobic disorder at some point in their lives.

So, having family members with phobias, anxiety disorders or other mental health conditions may make you more likely to have a similar disorder.\nOther phobias: Some people may have mysophobia (fear of germs) or osmophobia (fear of odors). These conditions can trigger an intense aversion to feet, which some people consider filthy, smelly or unhygienic.\nTrauma: If you\u2019ve ever had a serious foot injury or witnessed someone with foot trauma or disease, the experience could trigger podophobia.

        "What is pogonophobia?": "Pogonophobia is an extreme fear of beards. \u201cPogon\u201d comes from the Greek word for beards. Someone with pogonophobia may feel severe anxiety or panic around people with beards. They may also feel this way if they see a photo or video of someone with a beard. They might fear long, full beards, or any type of facial hair such as a mustache, goatee or \u201cfive o\u2019clock shadow\u201d. The condition can also make people scared of real beards or artificial beards that are part of costumes. If you have pogonophobia, it\u2019s impossible to predict when and where you might encounter someone with a beard.

        "What causes pogonophobia?": "A fear of beards can have a variety of causes, including: Associations: Some people associate beards with homelessness, poverty or illness. Or it may seem like someone is growing a beard to hide their face, suggesting mysterious or criminal behavior. Sometimes, beards also bring to mind certain religions or ethnicities. These are all stereotypes. You may not even realize that your fear stems from these types of generalizations about beards.\nFamily history: Genetics may play a role in phobias. The genes you inherit from your parents can increase your risk for anxiety and other mental health disorders. Studies suggest that between 25% and 65% of phobias have a genetic component. Researchers haven\u2019t identified a single \u201cphobia gene,\u201d so it\u2019s likely that multiple genes play a role in these conditions.\nOther phobias: Sometimes phobias overlap. For instance, if you have mysophobia (fear of dirt and germs) you may also be scared of beards because you feel they\u2019re filthy or unhygienic. People with Santaphobia (fear of Santa Claus) might get anxiety around beards, especially near the holidays. Trichophobia (fear of hair) can trigger a fear of beards, mustaches and all facial hair.\nTrauma: Abuse from someone with a beard can make you scared of beards. Or maybe you saw a scary movie where the villain had a beard. Even if these traumatic experiences occurred in the distant past, you may still connect them with beards in your mind.

        "What is porphyrophobia?": "Porphyrophobia is an extreme fear of the color purple. It\u2019s a type of chromophobia, which is a fear of colors. People with porphyrophobia may experience severe anxiety when they see or think of purple in any form, or it might be a reaction to specific shades of purple. They see the color as threatening. Like other phobias, porphyrophobia can negatively affect your mental health. As it\u2019s impossible to predict when and where you may see the color purple, the condition can make it hard to function in daily life. Porphyrophobia can lead to panic attacks.",
        "What does the color purple signify?": "\u201cPorphura\u201d is the ancient Greek word for purple. It originates from the purpura mollusk, which produced a purple substance used to dye clothes for royalty. Over the centuries, the color has come to symbolize: Calm.\nCreativity.\nDignity.\nFrustration and sadness.\nLuxury.\nMagic and mysticism.\nPower. In some cases, people who fear purple might be scared of the concepts, ideas or emotions they feel purple represents.",
        "What\u2019s the difference between porphyrophobia and porphyria?": "Porphyria describes a group of disorders that affect your skin and nervous system. You have red- and purple-colored chemicals in your body called porphyrins. Usually, these chemicals help create hemoglobin (a substance in your blood). But if you have porphyria, the porphyrins don\u2019t work correctly and build up in your body, making you sick.",

CBT also teaches techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to cope with the symptoms of a phobia.\nExposure therapy: Another form of psychotherapy gradually exposes you to the object of your fear. During exposure therapy, your therapist may ask you to look at pictures that contain purple things or hold a purple item. Over time, you may work on confronting the color purple in a public place or social situation. About 90% of people with specific phobic disorders can overcome their fear with exposure therapy.\nMedication: Medication doesn\u2019t treat the source of your fear and hasn\u2019t proven very effective for the long-term management of phobias. But if you must be in situations where the color purple will be present, talk to your doctor about anti-anxiety drugs. Certain medications can help you manage occasional panic attacks or other symptoms of fear and anxiety.",

        "What\u2019s the prognosis (outlook) for people with porphyrophobia?": "Psychotherapy is very effective for most people managing specific phobic disorders.
