Some research has found that the brain of a person with autism responds to physical touch the same way a person with haphephobia does. Not everyone with autism has haphephobia, and having haphephobia doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have autism. However, studies show that about half of all people with autism also have an anxiety disorder. Of that half, up to two in three have a specific phobia, which could include haphephobia. People with autism also commonly experience bullying or abuse, which can lead to haphephobia. A note from Cleveland ClinicHaphephobia is the fear of being touched. For some people, the fear is specific to being touched by people of one gender. For others, the fear extends to all people. People with haphephobia often experience physical symptoms of intense distress when they are touched. They may feel nauseated, flushed or like their heart is racing. Treatment such as therapy or medication helps many people manage haphephobia symptoms and live a more comfortable life. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 10/22/2021.
