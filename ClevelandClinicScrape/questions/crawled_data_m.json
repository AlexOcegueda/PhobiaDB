        "name": "Megalophobia",
        "description": "People with megalophobia have an intense fear of large objects such as skyscrapers, airplanes and big statues. Like other specific phobias, megalophobia is highly treatable with a psychological therapy called exposure therapy.",
        "What is megalophobia?": "Megalophobia is a type of anxiety disorder in which a person experiences intense fear of large objects. A person with megalophobia experiences intense fear and anxiety when they think of or are around large objects such as large buildings, statues, animals and vehicles. They often avoid situations or places that have large objects.",
        "What kind of large objects are people with megalophobia afraid of?": "The following objects can trigger people with megalophobia to experience intense fear and anxiety: Tall buildings, such as skyscrapers.\nLarge statues and monuments.\nLarge or vast natural features like mountains, volcanoes, lakes and oceans.\nBig boats, ships and barges.\nLarge vehicles, such as trains and buses.\nLarge or vast spaces, such as the inside of a stadium.\nBig animals, such as elephants and whales. Since there are many kinds of phobias, they can be a little challenging to diagnose. People who have megalophobia generally fear more than one kind of large object. There are other phobias that are characterized by a fear of something that happens to be large, but its size isn\u2019t the main aspect of the fear. As an example, if you have an intense fear of the ocean (which is a large \u201cobject\u201d) specifically, you may have thalassophobia, the fear of the ocean, and not megalophobia. If you\u2019re experiencing intense fear, it\u2019s important to see your healthcare provider so you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Who does megalophobia affect?": "Like other phobias, megalophobia can affect anyone at any age. Specific phobias, like megalophobia, are more likely to develop in children and become apparent in adolescents and young adults. Females are more likely to develop specific phobias.",
        "Is megalophobia common?": "Researchers don\u2019t yet know the exact number of people who have megalophobia, which is likely because many people with specific phobias like megalophobia don\u2019t seek treatment for their phobia. Specific phobias, in general, are a common mental health condition. Approximately 7 to 10% of the population has a phobia.",
        "What are the signs and symptoms of megalophobia?": [
            "people phobias often go extreme lengths avoid situations involve afraid person megalophobia able avoid large objects near large objects may experience following symptoms feel intense fear anxiety experience rapid heartbeat shortness breath feel dizzy lightheaded feel nauseous feel strong desire escape situation"
        ],
        "What causes megalophobia?": "Researchers aren\u2019t sure what exactly causes megalophobia. They believe that having a negative or traumatic experience that involved a large object may contribute to a person developing megalophobia.",
        "How is megalophobia diagnosed?": "Megalophobia is diagnosed through a thorough series of questions about the person\u2019s history, experiences and symptoms. Usually, you have to have had experienced persistent fear and anxiety of large objects for at least six months in order to be diagnosed with megalophobia. Your healthcare provider will likely use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a publication by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose megalophobia. Your provider will also rule out any other physical or mental health conditions that could be causing your symptoms. In general, phobias have at least four criteria for diagnosis, including: Intense and unreasonable fear: The fear of the object or situation is persistent and out of proportion to an appropriate level of fear.\nAnticipatory anxiety: An individual who has a phobia tends to dwell on or dread future situations or experiences that will involve the object or situation they are afraid of.\nAvoidance: Many people who have a phobia will actively avoid the feared object or situation. Some go to extreme lengths to avoid the thing they are afraid of.\nThe phobia interferes with day-to-day activities: The fear the individual experiences has to limit their everyday life in some way in order for it to be diagnosed as a phobia.",
        "Is there a test for megalophobia?": "There\u2019s no definitive test to diagnose megalophobia. Instead, your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your history, symptoms and experiences related to your fear of large objects to assess whether or not you have megalophobia.",
        "How is megalophobia treated?": [
            "megalophobia usually treated psychological treatment psychotherapy exposure therapy cognitive behavioral therapy common sometimes people need medications temporarily relieve symptoms fear anxiety order cope fear participating therapy exposure therapy exposure therapy common form psychological treatment used treat specific phobias people phobias usually avoid situations involve thing afraid able learn manage fear presented specific phobia feared outcomes often happen therapists psychologists use exposure therapy people phobia slowly encourage enter situations cause anxiety try stay situation learn cope megalophobia participate exposure therapy therapist psychologist may begin talking large objects may gradually move showing pictures large objects next may look near large object person process exposure therapy slow gradual therapist psychologist tailor pace therapy needs cognitive behavioral therapy cbt cbt form psychological treatment talking asking questions therapist psychologist helps gain different perspective result learn respond better cope stress anxiety feel exposed things cause fear"
        ],
        "What medications are used to treat megalophobia?": "Medications aren\u2019t usually used to treat specific phobias like megalophobia. But in some cases, people with megalophobia might take medications to temporarily help them relieve symptoms of fear and anxiety when they are going through psychological therapy to treat their phobia. Medications sometimes used to help treat megalophobia include: Beta blockers: Some beta blockers are used to treat or prevent physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a fast heart rate.\nSedatives (benzodiazepines): Benzodiazepines, which are a type of sedative, help you relax and reduce the amount of anxiety you feel.",
        "Is there a cure for megalophobia?": "There is currently no cure for megalophobia, but exposure therapy, a form of psychological therapy, is successful in treating it. Exposure therapy is considered the first-line treatment for specific phobias in general.",
        "What are the risk factors for developing megalophobia?": "Healthcare professionals are still trying to figure out the exact cause of megalophobia. So far, they\u2019ve found that the risk factors for developing megalophobia can include: Experiencing or witnessing a negative event that involved a large object, especially as a child.\nHaving a family history of anxiety disorders.",
        "What is the prognosis (outlook) for megalophobia?": "Only about 10 to 25% of people who have a specific phobia seek treatment for their condition because many can avoid the object or situation that they fear. If you have megalophobia, avoiding situations that involve large objects can prevent you from enjoying certain things in life like traveling and can lower your overall quality of life. This is why it\u2019s important to seek treatment. Everyone deserves a high quality of life. Research has shown that exposure therapy is successful in treating megalophobia and other specific phobias. People who have a specific phobia, like megalophobia, and don\u2019t seek treatment are two times more likely to develop an anxiety disorder and depression.",
        "How can I take care of myself if I have megalophobia?": "It can be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider if you\u2019re experiencing the signs and symptoms of megalophobia. Therapy can help you overcome your megalophobia. If you\u2019ve already been diagnosed with megalophobia, there are some things you can do to manage your symptoms and feel well, including: Get enough sleep and exercise.\nIf you are participating in psychological therapy to treat your megalophobia, be sure to see your therapist regularly.\nPractice mindfulness activities such as mediation.\nPractice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and yoga.\nReach out to family and friends for support.\nConsider joining a support group for people who have megalophobia or specific phobias in general.",
        "What questions should I ask my doctor?": "Talking about your mental health can be uncomfortable and scary. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health, so it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms. The following questions may be helpful to ask your provider if you have megalophobia: What kind of treatment do you recommend?\nShould I see a therapist, psychologist and/or psychiatrist?\nDo you have any recommendations for psychologists, psychiatrists or therapists that I could see?\nHow long will treatment take?\nDo you know of any support groups for megalophobia or phobias in general?\nDo you have any learning resources on megalophobia that I could read? A note from Cleveland Clinic If you have megalophobia, know that you are not alone. Many people all over the world have a phobia. Avoiding large objects can provide short-term relief, but this doesn\u2019t address the underlying cause of your fear and anxiety. Although it can be difficult and uncomfortable, it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider and seek proper treatment for your megalophobia. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you can take back control of your life. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 08/20/2021. Eaton WW, Bienvenu, OJ, Miloyan B.

Questions may include: How often do you think about germs?\nHave you experienced a traumatic event related to germs?\nHow do germs make you feel?\nIs mysophobia is causing behavioral changes that affect your happiness or daily routine?\nDo you have a personal or family history of anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder?\nAre you avoiding people or places you used to enjoy due to fear of germs?",
        "How can I overcome mysophobia?": "A common mysophobia treatment is exposure therapy. Working with your mental health provider, you explore the reasons behind your fear of germs. This is the first step in overcoming mysophobia. When you feel comfortable, your therapist gradually exposes you to situations where germs may be present. Therapy starts with low-risk exposures, such as thinking about germs. As you progress through treatment, exposures become more significant. You may touch unsanitized objects or start spending more time in public places. With successful treatment, you learn how to manage negative thoughts and feelings.",
        "Can other treatments help me cope with mysophobia?": "Additional treatments may include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Undergoing CBT helps you address why germs make you uncomfortable. You also learn methods for regaining control when these thoughts get overwhelming.\nMedications: Drugs don\u2019t cure mysophobia. But antidepressants can help with mood disorders, and anti-anxiety medications may help you cope in a stressful situation. If you\u2019re anxious about going out in public, medications may help.\nStress reduction: Yoga, meditation and other relaxation techniques quiet an overactive mind. This can make it easier to think positive thoughts instead of always bracing for the worst.",
        "Is there anything I can do to prevent mysophobia?": "If you have anxiety or OCD, it\u2019s important to find healthy ways of managing your thoughts and reactions to germs. Doing so may lower the risk of these situations escalating into a phobia. It\u2019s also possible to lower the risk of mysophobia by taking good care of your mental health. You can do this by: Limiting alcohol and recreational drug consumption.\nLowering stress during everyday activities.\nQuitting smoking and other forms of tobacco use.\nSpending time with loved ones.\nTaking up a new hobby to take your mind off germs and other stressors.",
