        "description": "Gamophobia \u2014 a fear of commitment or fear of marriage \u2014 can keep you from enjoying meaningful relationships.

        "What is gamophobia?": "People who have gamophobia have a fear of commitment. This fear is so intense that they often find it impossible to have long-term relationships. \u201cGamos\u201d is the Greek word for marriage. \u201cPhobos\u201d (phobia) means fear. Some people can\u2019t commit to long-term plans like choosing a college, making a career choice or picking a place to live. This fear of commitment differs from gamophobia, which is specifically about personal relationships. People with gamophobia may: Be unable to form lasting intimate relationships.\nExperience extreme anxiety when in a relationship and constantly worry about the relationship ending.\nFeel anxiety when they see a happily committed couple.\nPush people away or end relationships abruptly.",
        "How common is gamophobia?": "It\u2019s hard to know exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like gamophobia (fear of commitment).

        "Who is at risk for gamophobia?": "People with personality disorders like borderline personality disorder (BPD) may avoid commitment due to an intense fear of being abandoned or rejected. They also tend to have trust issues. Other risk factors for gamophobia include: Family history: Growing up with a parent or loved one who has a phobia or anxiety disorder may lead you to develop the same or similar fears.\nBiological sex: People designated female at birth (DFAB) tend to develop specific phobic disorders more often than those designated male at birth (DMAB).\nGenetics: Preliminary research suggests that certain people have a gene change (gene mutation) that increases their risk for anxiety or phobic disorders.",
        "What other phobias are associated with commitment phobia?": "Many people have more than one phobia. Usually, the phobias have some common tie. For instance, someone with a fear of commitment may also have: Philophobia (fear of love).\nPistanthrophobia (fear of trusting others or being hurt by someone you love).\nGenophobia (fear of sex or sexual intimacy).\nFear of abandonment.",
        "Why do I have a fear of commitment?": "Many people trace their fear of commitment or fear of marriage to past traumatic experiences. Gamophobia can be a protective response. You can\u2019t experience heartache if you don\u2019t allow yourself to commit to a long-term relationship. Potential gamophobia causes include: Parental discord: Children who witness their parents\u2019 contentious divorce or relationship may grow up fearful of making a commitment that leads to the same conflicts.\nPrevious heartbreaks: Adults who experience heartache from a breakup, divorce or infidelity may shy away from getting involved with someone again. Over time, their choice can become fear.\nFear of missing out: Some people may worry about committing to the wrong person and not being available when the right partner comes along.\nCultural or religious pressures: Certain cultures arrange marriages without taking love and other emotions into consideration. You may be afraid to fully commit to the relationship because you didn\u2019t have a say in choosing your partner. Someone who is LGBTQ+ may fear marriage if their religion or culture opposes the union.",

They may refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in phobias and anxiety disorders.",
        "How do you get over fear of commitment?": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy (talk therapy), helps many people overcome commitment phobia. CBT gets to the underlying cause of the thoughts that make you fear commitment. A mental health professional helps you change these negative perceptions into positive perceptions about commitment and marriage. You also learn how to best communicate with your loved ones about this phobia. You may also get systemic desensitization therapy. This type of exposure therapy helps most people overcome specific phobic disorders. Exposure therapy: Teaches you how to use relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises and meditation to manage symptoms.\nGradually exposes you to the idea of making a commitment.\nGives you real-world tasks to help you become more comfortable committing to a long-term relationship.",
        "What are the complications of gamophobia?": "Constantly pushing away people you love or running away from relationships can negatively affect your physical and mental health. You may experience: Depression and suicidal thoughts.\nErectile dysfunction.\nAnxiety and panic disorder.\nSubstance use disorder.",
        "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping.\nSigns of depression or substance use problems. You may want to ask your healthcare provider: What is causing this phobia?\nWhat is the best treatment for me?\nShould I try psychotherapy?\nHow long will I need therapy?\nShould I watch for signs of complications? A note from Cleveland Clinic Many people have doubts (what\u2019s known as cold feet) when entering into a committed relationship. But for people with gamophobia, the fear can be paralyzing. It can keep you from moving forward in a relationship or establishing intimate bonds with others. If you\u2019ve experienced heartache, gamophobia may be a way to protect yourself from feeling that pain again. A therapist can help you learn to let go of this fear. In time, you can be in a committed relationship. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 03/22/2022. American Psychological Association. What Is Exposure Therapy?

        "Why do I have a fear of knees?": "Some people are repulsed by the bony appearance of knees. The idea of seeing or touching knees (their own or someone else\u2019s), kneeling or crossing legs brings on feelings of disgust, anxiety or fear. If you were brought up in a culture or religion that required covering knees, you may have a hard time not thinking of exposed knees as sinful or bad. Seeing exposed knees may make you feel anxious or frightened. Someone with genuphobia may view their knees as a weak part of their body that\u2019s vulnerable to injuries. This fear may result from an earlier traumatic knee injury that happened while skiing, playing sports or in a car accident. Or you may have cared for someone recovering from a knee injury or procedure. For some people, seeing a horrific blow to the knees in a movie (like breaking kneecaps) can bring on genuphobia.

        "How is genuphobia diagnosed?": "The American Psychiatric Association doesn\u2019t recognize fear of knees or fear of knee injuries as a phobic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Still, help is available. A psychologist or other mental health professional can diagnose genuphobia based on your symptoms. Your healthcare provider considers these criteria to make a specific phobic disorder diagnosis: Feelings of dread, fear or anxiety when you see knees, touch knees or think about knee injuries despite knowing you aren\u2019t in danger.\nChronic fear of knees or injuries that lasts for at least six months.\nImmediate symptoms when you\u2019re exposed to knees or think about knee injuries.\nBehavior changes to avoid kneeling, crossing legs or having to see, touch or think about knees.\nSevere symptoms that interfere with your ability to work, socialize and enjoy life.",

Most people with specific phobias improve with exposure therapy.\nHypnotherapy uses guided relaxation techniques to help you change your perceptions and responses to knees.\nAnti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants may help while you\u2019re getting therapy. Your healthcare provider may also recommend beta-blockers like propranolol (Inderal\u00ae) to reduce physical symptoms of anxiety.

This fear of leaving a safe place can lead to another phobia called agoraphobia. You may become sedentary to lower your risk of a knee injury.

A note from Cleveland Clinic With few exceptions, almost all of us have knees. That makes it difficult to avoid exposure to knees, especially during the summer when people wear shorts and skirts.
