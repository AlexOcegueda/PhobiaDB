        "description": "Eisoptrophobia is an unhealthy fear of mirrors. Some people fear mirrors due to self-image issues. People may also avoid mirrors because they distort the way an object looks. This phobia leads to lifestyle changes that enable people to avoid mirrors.",
        "What is eisoptrophobia?": "You may have eisoptrophobia if you have an intense fear of mirrors. Eisoptrophobia is a specific phobia, which means it causes fear of a particular situation. The fear is typically much greater than the actual risk of danger. Eisoptrophobia may also be called spectrophobia or catoptrophobia. People with a specific phobia often have many phobias. In addition to eisoptrophobia, they may also have: Atelophobia: Fear of imperfection.\nCacophobia: Fear of ugliness.\nChromophobia: Fear of colors.\nKoinoniphobia: Fear of rooms.\nObesophobia: Fear of gaining weight.\nSanguivoriphobia: Fear of vampires (according to folklore, they have no reflection in mirrors).\nThanatophobia: Fear of death.",
        "Do I have eisoptrophobia?": "Mirrors are typically a part of everyday life. They help us see images of ourselves and can protect us from danger (for example, mirrors in or on vehicles). But some people fear images due to self-image issues. People may also avoid mirrors because they may distort the way an object looks. If you have eisoptrophobia, the thought of mirrors can bring intense anxiety. This can sometimes lead to panic attacks. If you have signs of eisoptrophobia, discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. You should be honest with them about what you are experiencing. They can offer reassurance and refer you to therapies that make life a little less stressful.",
        "What causes a fear of mirrors?": "Many healthcare providers agree that genetics and your environment can increase your risk: Genetics: A family history of mood disorders means you may carry genes that cause phobias.\nEnvironment: If you experience emotional trauma related to mirrors, you may be more likely to develop a phobia of them. Some people have bad experiences with mirrors because of scary movies or mirror-based attractions at carnivals. Cultural beliefs may also play a role in eisoptrophobia. Many cultures believe that the souls of deceased loved ones travel through or get trapped in mirrors. This is why mirrors are often covered or turned away when a family is in mourning.",

It can prevent you from relaxing, participating in social activities or eating complete, nutritious meals. Emetophobia is a \u201cspecific phobia\u201d in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

For example, you might develop emetophobia if you: Vomited in public or in front of someone else.\nHad an illness (like the stomach flu, food poisoning or alcohol poisoning) that caused a lot of vomiting.\nChoked on food. Emetophobia can also develop when you experience other related mental health conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or an eating disorder. Triggers are things or events that cause symptoms. Triggers of emetophobia may include: Feeling nauseous.\nSeeing someone else vomit.\nHearing or saying words related to vomiting.\nBeing in a new place, because you don\u2019t know where the nearest bathroom is.\nBeing around foods or beverages that previously caused vomiting.

A provider will diagnose emetophobia through a thorough series of questions about your history, experiences and symptoms. Usually, your persistent fear and anxiety about vomiting happen for at least six months in order to be diagnosed with emetophobia. Your healthcare provider will likely use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a publication by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose emetophobia. Your provider will also rule out any other physical or mental health conditions that could be causing your symptoms. In general, phobias have at least four criteria for diagnosis, including: Intense and unreasonable fear: Your fear of vomiting is persistent and out of proportion to an appropriate level of fear.\nAnticipatory anxiety: You tend to dwell on or dread future situations or experiences that could involve nausea and vomiting.\nAvoidance: You actively avoid vomiting and things that might lead to it. You may go to extreme lengths to try to avoid vomiting.\nThe phobia interferes with day-to-day activities: Your fear limits your everyday life in some way.",

A note from Cleveland Clinic Depending on where you live and the types of activities you enjoy, it may be easy or difficult to avoid seeing horses. But even in cities, police officers often patrol on horseback and horses may take tourists around to see the sights. Because having a phobia increases your risk for other phobias, anxiety disorder and panic attacks, it\u2019s best to seek help to overcome this fear. Psychotherapies, including CBT and exposure therapy, can make it easier for you to be around horses. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 03/24/2022.
