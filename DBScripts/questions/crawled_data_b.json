You may not need these medications after you finish therapy.",

Your need to feel secure may cause you to stay home to avoid falling or encountering phobia triggers. This avoidance can cause you to miss out on fun or necessary parts of life. Phobic disorders also increase your risk of: Depression, social isolation and suicidal thoughts.\nPanic attacks and panic disorder.\nSubstance use disorder.",
            "When should I call the doctor?": "You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: Panic attacks.\nPersistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping.\nSigns of depression or problems with substances.
